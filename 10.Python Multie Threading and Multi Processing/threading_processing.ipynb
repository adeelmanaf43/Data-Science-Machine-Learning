    "\n",
    "##### Process\n",
    "A process is simply an instance of a program that is being executed. It works along with the OS. The sources that are required to run the process are: Code Segment, Data Segment, Heap, Stack, Register.\n",
    "Every process when we run it, it will have seperate memory space. One process cannot corrupt another process. It requires some others I/O requirements. \n",
    "Increased execution time to swith between process.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: Browser, Excel.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Thread\n",
    "A thread is a unit of execution within a process.\n",
    "\n",
    "Single Threaded Process -> This thread has its own stack and register but its sharing the code segment, data segment and heap from process.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: MS Paint (process) -> creating a rectangle (new thread is created), creating a circle (another thread is created)\n",
    "\n",
    "Multi Threaded Process -> Multipe threads (each thread will have its own stack and register)."
