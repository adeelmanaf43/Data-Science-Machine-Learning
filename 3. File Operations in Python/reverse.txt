The sun rises in the east and sets in the west.  
A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step.  
Knowledge is power, but wisdom is applying it.  
Success comes to those who work hard and never give up.  
The river flows gently, carving its path through the land.  
Change is the only constant in life.  
Happiness is found in the little moments of everyday life.
